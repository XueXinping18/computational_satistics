# Computational Satistics
This repository includes my implementation of the programming assignments in the advanced undergraduate course Computational Statistics. <br>
This is one of the most difficult courses in the department of Statistics, with topics including solving nonlinear equations, optimization, simulation, numerical and Monte Carlo Integration, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, nonparametric density estimation, and bootstrapping.<br>
A number of famous **algorithms in the field of computation** and their important applications are implemented, including Newton's method, Fisher's Scoring method, EM Optimization, Sequential Importance Sampling, Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm, Gibbs Sampling, Kalman Filter, Particle Filter, Wild Bootstraping, etc.
